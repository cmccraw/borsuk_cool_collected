# Amaranth Borsuk's _The Book_  ::  ENGL 804 Discussion

## Small Group Research:
**Group Reporter**: Whoever’s book companion has the most recent publication date. 

**5 min.:** Do some digital digging about the assigned book, noting what information or images are available virtually. 

**10 min.:** Prepare the following for the class:
1. 30-second introduction to the book (date, author, basics)
2. How does this book challenge or reinforce historical expectations of what a book should be? (Drawing from Borsuk, with possible considerations including the book as object, as content, as idea, as interface)
3. At least one specific request for Josh’s showing of the book (“Can you find a page where XYZ happens? What does it smell like?” etc.)
